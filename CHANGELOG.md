# Change Log

## [0.0.3]

- In preferences, added a `User mode` to choose between `developer mode` and `skeleton editor mode`. 
The first one is suitable for users whose goal is to generate documents with the SKodgee tool. 
The second one is useful for those who create and maintain SKodgee skeletons.
- The skeleton location in SKodgee preferences was a unique location ; now several locations can be declared, so 
user can manage multiple skeleton collections without having to swap between location each time.

## [0.0.2]

- `calc` directive is now effective
- `include` directive is now effective

## [0.0.1]

- Initial version, with some issues ;)
